## About the project:

- This project was developed using express and inquirer. The game is played in the terminal using inquirer. Express is used to create the database. The database is used to store the users username and the values of the choices the player makes to determine how mush gold doubloons the player receives. It also provides the prompts for the player, the choices they can make, and correctly directs the player to the next prompt based on the choice they make.
